# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Environment Setup

This project uses a single `.env` file for both frontend and backend to manage development and production environments. The environment variables are:

```
# Environment Configuration
NODE_ENV=development  # Change to 'production' for production build

# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:5001/api  # Development API URL
REACT_APP_API_URL_PROD=https://lyra-games.onrender.com/api  # Production API URL

# Server Configuration
PORT=5001  # Development port
PORT_PROD=5001  # Production port

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bludyclud  # Development MongoDB URI
MONGO_URI_PROD=mongodb://your-production-mongodb-uri/bludyclud  # Production MongoDB URI

# Set this to true to use production values regardless of NODE_ENV
FORCE_PRODUCTION=false
REACT_APP_FORCE_PRODUCTION=false
```

To switch between development and production environments, you can either:
1. Change `NODE_ENV` to 'production'
2. Set `FORCE_PRODUCTION=true` and `REACT_APP_FORCE_PRODUCTION=true`

Note: The backend directory uses a symbolic link to the root .env file, so there's only one file to maintain.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
